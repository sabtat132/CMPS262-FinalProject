# CMPS262 FinalProject : DJD Properties Web Application
This website will be for DJD Properties; which is my family's rental property business. Currently, the business is very outdated in terms of technology and a digital presence. Through the creation of a web application this will improve many processes such as available property listings/search, FAQ of policies, and a tenant portal (pay rent electronically, request maintenance, and more).

## What is the purpose of the DJD Properties Website
They have never had an online presence, and previously have been using Facebook Market Place and Craiglist ads to promote their available listings. On top of that, other business practices are very out-dated and can be more easily streamlined by using a website application that can do it all. 
For example, they can have available property listings, policies, tenant portal to pay rent and request maintenance, and more. 

## What programming languages/Apis will be utilized
```
HTML
CSS
JQuery
JavaScript
SQL & php (contact form)
Bootsrap
Google - Maps API (location of property on maps)
```

## Filter Property Feature
This is an example of how I may implement the filter functionality - I'm thinking of filtering by location since all of our properties are about the same size (ex: 2-3 bedroom and 1 bath). This feature will use javascript and HTML.

## Login Portal for Tenants
This is an example of how I might create the login portal for the current tenants. This feature will use PHP, HTML, and CSS (this may be able to use mySQL in order to store those who are tenants as site users).

## Property Listing - Image Gallery
In order to show the property listings, we will need to include photo galleries of each property listing. This gallery will be using CSS and HTML.

## Payment Integration - Paypal
In order to pay rent electronically, we will integrate a payment system - example: Paypal in order to pay rent online. This will utilize mySQL, PHP, jQuery, and HTML5.

## Property Location - Using API
In order to view the property location, we could always do a Google Maps Iframe, although, we will be using a Google Maps API key in order to have the property listing via Google Maps.
