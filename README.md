# CMPS262-FinalProject : DJD Properties Web Application - Website
This website will be for DJD Properties; which is my family's rental property business. Currently, the business is very outdated in terms of technology and a digital presence. Through the creation of a web application this will improve many processes such as available property listings/search, FAQ of policies, and a tenant portal (pay rent electronically, request maintenance, and more). 

:PROPERTY_APP: DJD Properties
:PROPERTY_LOC: Pittsburgh
:PROPERTY_ENV: Staging
:PROPERTY_URL: Working Web Address - https://statal.it.pointpark.edu/djdproperties.html
:PROPERTY_STATUS: Not Available Currently
:PROPERTY_VERSION: 1.0

## What is the purpose of the DJD Properties Website
They have never had an online presence, and previously have been using Facebook Market Place and Craiglist ads to promote their available listings. On top of that, other business practices are very out-dated and can be more easily streamlined by using a website application that can do it all. 
For example, they can have available property listings, policies, tenant portal to pay rent and request maintenance, and more.
