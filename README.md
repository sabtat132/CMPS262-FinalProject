# CMPS262-FinalProject : DJD Properties Web Application - Website
This website will be for DJD Properties; which is my family's rental property business. Currently, the business is very outdated in terms of technology and a digital presence. Through the creation of a web application this will improve many processes such as available property listings/search, FAQ of policies, and a tenant portal (pay rent electronically, request maintenance, and more).

## What is the purpose of the DJD Properties Website
They have never had an online presence, and previously have been using Facebook Market Place and Craiglist ads to promote their available listings. On top of that, other business practices are very out-dated and can be more easily streamlined by using a website application that can do it all. 
For example, they can have available property listings, policies, tenant portal to pay rent and request maintenance, and more.

## Filter Property Feature
This is an example of how I may implement the filter functionality - I'm thinking of filtering by location since all of our properties are about the same size (ex: 2-3 bedroom and 1 bath).

## Login Portal for Tenants
This is an example of how I might create the login portal for the current tenants.

## Property Listing - Image Gallery
In order to show the property listings, we will need to include photo galleries of each property listing.

## Payment Integration - Paypal
In order to pay rent electronically, we will integrate a payment system - example: Paypal in order to pay rent online.
