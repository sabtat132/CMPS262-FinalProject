##What is DJD Properties
DJD Properties is a family run rental company business that has been around for over 30 years in the city of Pittsburgh. They feature various property such as lots, commercial property, houses, and apartments for rent. 

##What is the DJD Properties Website
They have never had an online presence, and previously have been using Facebook Market Place and Craiglist ads to promote their available listings. On top of that, other business practices are very out-dated and can be more easily streamlined by using a website application that can do it all. 
For example, they can have available property listings, policies, tenant portal to pay rent and request maintenance, and more.
